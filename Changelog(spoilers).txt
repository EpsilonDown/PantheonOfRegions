# Pantheon of Regions

==== spoilers ahead obviously ===

Gorb + Vengefly Kings
Massive Moss Charger + Hornet 1
Mawlek + Failed Champion: Failed Champion instantly gets up from stun except for the last.
Sisters of Battle + Elder Hu: All dream warriors mostly stay on upper part of arena for better gameplay.
Enraged Guardian + Xero
Nosk + Galien: Greatly reduced Galien hammer acceleration because it's genuinely ass, also no mini-hammers spawn but that's for better.
Marmu + Traitor Lord: Traitor Lord can immediately use slam & boomerang without health threshold.
Hornet 2 + Hive Knight: Hive Knight can immediately use every attack.
Soul Tyrant + Soul Warrior: Tyrant spawns folly & blob with every attack on phase 2
Uumuu + no eyes: Removed no eye's teleport chance on getting hit because it's annoying enough
White Defender + Flukemarm
All nailmasters
God Tamer + Oblobble: Oblobble changes to raged one mid fight.
Collector + Watcher Knights: ...chaos.
Gruzmother + Sly: Idk why but Sly's rage attack is bugged, and he sometimes teleports.
Zote + NKG: Zote does not jump during NKG's spike attack. Only 3 Zote Balloons. Gonna look forward to changing more cuz it's too hard.
PV + LostKin: Lostkin does not randomly jump after getting damaged. PV also can immeediately use every attack.
Radiance + Markoth: Good luck. Make sure to dreamnail Seer on ultimate attack.

Looking for difficulty feedbacks. Feel free to comment.
